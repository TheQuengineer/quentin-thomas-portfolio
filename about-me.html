        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>My name is Quentin, and I love testing technology. Its interesting to note that I didn't
        really start to develop this passion until much later in my life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The older I get the more I start to discover how deep my appetite for creativity goes. I'm always looking for the next big thing to bring into existance, and I can't wait to see what comes out of my brain next.</p>
        <p> Im in the midst of working to start my own tech firm that will allow me to work on my own project ideas that interest me in the field of test automation.</p>

          <h1>More about me</h1>
          <p>I'm the type of person that loves learning new things. One new thing that I'm just coming to like is front end web development. I think the future is headed more so towards front end dynamic applications and I feel now is the time to harden that specific skill.</p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Some of my hobbies include weight training, gaming, table tennis, as well as organizing group events for me and my closest friends. My favorite music to listen to right now has been Ambient Sounds on pandora. It has been a great stress relief, and quite frankly it keeps me in a good mood, because its so peaceful.
